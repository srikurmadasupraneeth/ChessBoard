Checkerboard Pattern with Python Turtle  

This project demonstrates how Python can be used for **automated tasks** and leverages the **Turtle graphics library** to create a checkerboard pattern. It showcases Python's capabilities in simple visual design and programmatic drawing.

🛠️ Project Overview  
This script creates an 8x8 checkerboard pattern with alternating black and white squares. It uses Python's `turtle` library to draw and fill the squares programmatically.

Key Features:  
- Utilizes the **Turtle Graphics** library for drawing.  
- Dynamically fills squares with alternating colors based on row and column indices.  
- Adjusts position programmatically for each row and column.  
- Demonstrates how Python can automate repetitive drawing tasks.

📖 How It Works  
1. The script defines a method `draw()` to draw a single square.  
2. Using nested loops, it iterates through the rows and columns of the checkerboard.  
3. Alternating colors (black and white) are determined using a simple conditional check.  
4. The `pen` object from the `turtle` library is used to draw and fill the squares.  

🛠️ Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- Turtle graphics package (pre-installed in Python)  

🚀 Run the Script  
1. Copy the code into a `.py` file (e.g., `checkerboard.py`).  
2. Run the script using `python checkerboard.py`.  
3. The Turtle Graphics window will display the checkerboard pattern.  

🌟 Why I Chose Python's Turtle Library  
In future, I plan to expand this project to mimic a full **chessboard**. I chose to use **Python's Turtle library** because:  
- I am not creating a game engine at this stage but focusing on understanding how Python can be used for graphical output.  
- Turtle graphics is simple to use and provides an easy way to visualize algorithms.  
- It's ideal for learning and experimenting with drawing and animation, making it a great fit for projects like this one.

🖼️ Demo Output  
When you run the script, an 8x8 checkerboard pattern like the following is displayed:
